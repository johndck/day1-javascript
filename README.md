# Luxury Tax Calculator

- As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will calculate how much luxury tax a hypothetical sports team will pay to sign three players.

## Instructions

- Create three variables that contain the salaries for each player (without the dollar sign or commas).
- Calculate and display the total salary for all three players.
  - If the team exceeded their spending limit, calculate and display the cost of the luxury tax.
  - The team's spending limit is $40,000,000.
  - The tax rate is 18%. Note that the 18% luxury tax is only paid on the the amount of salary OVER the team's spending limit. For example, if a team's payroll is $55,000,000, they only pay luxury tax on $15,000,000.

\*\* In my solution I am using template literals as I prefer them to writing concatenation with extra "" - its just my standard and preference. I find it easier overall.

CHALLENGE #extra

There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

Your tasks:

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data included below. The average score for Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, and the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the scoreKoalas variable.

2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print to the console:

"Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or

"Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or

"Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal.

TEST DATA: Dolphins scored 96, 108, and 89. Koalas scored 88, 91, and 110.
